# Dynamic Fantasy Name Generator

> CAUTION: This code serves as a learning tool and reflects my early stages of coding. It's not recommended for use in production environments.

A simple fantasy name generator, built from scratch with a unique approach.

This project marks the beginning of my journey into the realm of coding. It was one of my first ventures into developing an application based solely on my own concepts and methodologies. Despite my limited experience with statistics at the time, I was driven by a passion for learning and growth. This repository serves as a testament to where it all began.
